%TOC%

This plugin implements a set of additional special purpose formfields to be used in [[%SYSTEMWEB%.DataForms][DataForm]] definitions.

These are:

   * =ipaddress=: a general purpose IP4 address, consisting of 4 octets, e.g. =10.0.0.1=
   * =netmask=: a special IP address used for routing, consisting of 4 octets, e.g. =255.255.255.0=
   * =macaddress=: a hardware address given in 6 hex values, e.g. =00:1a:10:6f:ba:12=
   * =topic=: topic autocomplete. Parameters can be added in the value column and are structured like macro parameters, with the following options available:
      * =web=: the web the user can choose topics from; defaults to current web
      * =default=: the default value to use if no value exists yet
      * =url=: URL for autocomplete, default: =%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%SYSTEMWEB%/MoreFormfieldsAjaxHelper?section&#61;select2::topic;skin&#61;text;contenttype&#61;application/json%3Bcharset%3Dutf-8=
      * ... and any select2 option
   * =user=: user autocomplete. Parameters work the same way as for =topic= and the same parameters are available.
      * =url=: default: =%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%SYSTEMWEB%/MoreFormfieldsAjaxHelper?section&#61;select2::user;skin&#61;text;contenttype&#61;application/json%3Bcharset%3Dutf-8=
   * =select2=: Select2 widget with pre-defined available values (or an arbitrary AJAX helper). Parameters work the same way as for =topic=, but in the 'attributes' column. Be careful to not accidentally use a capital 'H' or 'M' in any parameter because otherwise the field will be interpreted as hidden or mandatory.
      * In the values column, just like in the =textboxlist= widget, put a URL to use it as an AJAX helper, or a comma-separated list of values just like for a normal select. (For select2+values you can use a list of mapped values as for select+values.)
      * =placeholder=: string to show when no value has been selected.
      * =width=: how to calculate the element's width (see Select2 documentation for details).
      * =allowClear=: true if there should be a button to empty the widget.
      * =initUrl=: URL to an AJAX helper that will generate a display version of a pre-set value. The helper expects an =id= GET parameter containing the pre-set value, and is expected to return a JSON object consisting of an =id= and a =text= member. If no helper is defined, the raw value will be displayed instead. This is currently not supported for =multi= elements.
      * =ajaxPassFields=: comma-separated list of =key:value= pairs; =value= is the name of a form field and =key= is the name of the GET parameter in which the AJAX helper will receive the current value of that form field. This allows for AJAX queries parameterized on other form fields.
   * =firstallcheckbox=: behaves just like the normal checkbox type, but the first checkbox in the list is assumed to have a special meaning: its value is taken to mean "all options". Therefore, checking the first box will automatically uncheck all others, and checking any other box will uncheck the first. Add '+last' to the type to make the last checkbox special instead. The '+buttons' subtype normally available for 'checkbox' is not supported.
   * =autofill=
   * =phonenumber=
   * =time=
   * =icon=
